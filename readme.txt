Shortcodes for simple, responsive columns.

== Description ==
Shortcodes for simple, responsive columns. Includes thirds, halves, and three-column flowing text

== Installation ==
No installation needed – Just jump right in to using the shortcodes in the page/post editor.
These shortcodes work in pairs – Be sure to use the couples together in the proper way – do not "mix-and-match". And don't forget the closing tag (e.g. "[/half_first]").

== Shortcodes ==

/* 1/2 */
[half_first]

/* 2/3 left, 1/3 right */
[twothirds_first]
[onethird_last]

/* 1/3 left, 2/3 right */
