Shortcodes for simple, responsive columns.

== Description ==
Shortcodes for simple, responsive columns. Includes thirds, halves, and three-column flowing text.

== Installation ==
No installation needed. Just jump right in to using the shortcodes in the page/post editor.
These shortcodes work in pairs, so be sure to use the couples together in the proper way. Do not "mix-and-match".
